# WIPchessEngine
Complex programming project
Represent the chess board and pieces: You will need to represent the chess board and pieces in your program. One way to do this is to use a 2D array to represent the board, with each element of the array representing a square on the board. You could use a number or character to represent each piece, or create a class for each type of piece (e.g., a "Pawn" class, a "Knight" class, etc.)

Implement the rules of chess: You will need to implement the rules of chess in your program, including things like how pieces move and capture other pieces, the rules for castling, en passant, and promotion, and the concept of check and checkmate.

Implement a search algorithm: To allow the chess engine to "think" and decide on its next move, you will need to implement a search algorithm. One option is to use the minimax algorithm, which involves evaluating all possible moves the engine could make and all the possible countermoves its opponent could make, and then choosing the move that maximizes its score while minimizing the opponent's score.

Evaluate positions: To help the search algorithm decide on the best move, you will need to implement a function that evaluates the relative strength of a given position. This could involve assigning point values to different pieces and counting the total number of each type of piece on the board, among other things.

Add a user interface: Finally, you will need to add a user interface so that people can play against your chess engine. This could involve creating a graphical board representation and allowing the user to input their moves through the keyboard or mouse.
